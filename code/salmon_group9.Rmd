## Overview

This “Overview” section (above the tabs) should contain, in whatever order you choose: 

- An engaging image (with caption, including photo credit) that is relevant to the dataset
- A brief summary (3 - 4 sentences) of the dataset, and what is included in this “report”
- A map of the fish ladder location (you can make this in R on your own, or include an existing map appropriately licensed, with attribution)
- A professionally formatted data citation
- Remember: All code that you used to wrangle the data and prepare the graphs should be available to see if we click on the Code buttons. 

Fish species traveling through Willamette river to the Columbia River Basin are recorded daily. Steelhead, Coho, and Jack Coho salmon are three of the species recorded by Columbia Basin Research. The dataset used in this exploration includes the number of fish observed daily, for each fish species from 2001-2010. This report attempts to find seasonal and overall trends of the number of each fish species observed traveling from the Wilamette River to the Columbia river using time series modeling.

## Data Analysis {.tabset}
### Original Time Series 

```{r}
# Read in salmon data from csv and clean names

 - According to Figure 1, there appears to be seasonality in the observances of Jack Coho, Coho, and Steelhead salmon. The peak number of observances for Jack Coho and Coho salmon look to occur at later months of the year, while Steelhead salmon observances peak around the middle of the year.
 - Steelhead Salmon have the most consistent overall seasonality, however, they experienced a particularly high number of observations in 2004 followed by a decline in 2005. Observations of Steelhead salmon have  become relatively consistent from 2006 through 2010, with 2010 experiencing slightly higher number of observations
 - The overall trend of Coho Salmon seems to have fluctuated over the years. First increasing from 2001-2004, then decreasing up until 2007, where there was a strong peak, before a decline in 2007. There appears to be a strong upward trend from 2008-2010.
 - Jack Coho salmon follow a similar trend as Coho Salmon, first increasing in the number of observations from 2001-2003, then decreasing  until 2007 where observations saw a relatively high number of Jack Coho salmon before returning to a low level in 2007 and then reaching a maximum number of observations in late 2008. Jack coho observations then declined in 2009 and then slightly increased in 2010.

- Figure 2 indicates a strong similarity in the seasonal behavior between Jack Coho and Coho species of salmon. Their numbers both tend to spike specifically around the month of October for all recorded years, though for Coho we have historically seen much higher individual counts than for the Jack Coho.
- Steelhead observations tend to be much more spread out than either of the other two, but still confined to a broader trend of activity that takes place between January through July. There is a much greater variance between months, indicating a possible difference in behavioral patterns where Steelhead presence is spread out a bit more over time, and Coho and Jack Coho tend to be consolidated to single events - but the adherence to this general time span is maintained across all years for Steelhead.


### Annual counts by species {.tabset}

This “Summary statistics and analysis” tab should contain: 

- A finalized figure of annual totals for fish passage, for each of the 3 species (coho, jack coho, steelhead). You decide if this is in a single panel, or multiple panels. Add a figure caption. 
- Add 2-3 bulletpoints summarizing major trends you see in the annual totals by species from 2000 - 2010.
- Remember: All code that you used to wrangle the data and prepare the graphs should be available to see if we click on the Code buttons.
